This is a simple example on using tools `capture`, `points`, `pre` and `title`.

Remember to read comments in `run.sh` and `config.yaml`.

In short, using `capture` is a good idea when you are running a single test, even though this example includes two.
When running multiple tests, it's recommended to look into `testcase`.
