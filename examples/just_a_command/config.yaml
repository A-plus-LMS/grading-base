title: Just a command pattern
description: An example of using just a command without run.sh
instructions: |
    <h4>The problem</h4>
    <p>
        In this exercise you must implement a shell script tbat
        reads two numbers per line and calculates addition.
        All results that are greater than 10 should be limited to 10.
        Your script should print line per input line in format
        <code>a + b = c</code> where a and b are the given numbers
        and c is the result.
    </p>
    </p>
    <h4>Grading</h4>
    <p>
        In contrary to other examples, in this one we don't use <code>run.sh</code>.
        Everything is done in single command written in <code>config.yaml</code>.
        Note the <code>--sh</code> in the command.
        It makes sure quotes are handled correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
        This exercise uses utility <code>testcase</code> to do
        a simple multipart grading.
        In addition, we show how <code>stdio-diff</code> can be
        used to do simple input/output comparison.
        Unit testing should be preferred over input/output testing,
        though it does work for some cases.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember to check project README and <code>run.sh</code> for more information.
