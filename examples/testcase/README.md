This example shows how to use tools `testcase`, `stdio-diff` and of course `grade`.
These tools make `run.sh` way simpler when compared to the capture pattern.

Remember to read comments in `run.sh` as well in `config.yaml`.

These utility commands are handy, when you don't have test framework that would natively support splitting feedback to multiple files.
In future, grading service can have a template for rendering feedback data.
